This is the E-Prime Code for the Probabilistic Learning Task as has been used in:

van den Bos, W.*, Crone, E. A.* & Güroğlu, B. (2012). Brain function during feedback-based learning in relation to IQ and level of education. Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience.2(1):78-89

van den Bos, W., Cohen, M.X., Kahnt, T. & Crone, E. A. (2011). Striatum-medial prefrontal cortex connectivity predicts developmental changes in reinforcement learning. Cerebral Cortex.

van den Bos, W., Güroğlu, B., van der Bulk, B. G., Rombouts, S.A.R.B. & Crone, E. A. (2009) Better than expected or as bad as you thought? The neurocognitive development of probabilistic feedback processing. Frontiers in Neuroscience, 3:52    

The task is very straightforward and details can be found in the papers (http://decisionneuroscience.bits-of-information.org/p/publications.html). But if there are any questions feel free to e-mail me (woutervdbos @ gmail.com)
